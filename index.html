          <h2>Never Forget To Water Your Plants Again!</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>Finally, a water reminder app for your plants</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            It’s easy to forget to water your plants, but we can change that.
            Water My Plants reminds you to water plants through notifications and on a schedule you control. We also give you a plant gallery that you can update as your plant collection grows.

            <bold>Love,</bold>
            I love this app. I'm very bad at drinking water, so I need something
            that makes the task enjoyable. This app does just that. It's
            colorful and simple to use. So glad I found Water My Plants. Three
            months, going strong.

            <bold>Cute idea, needs work.</bold>
            I love the idea of taking a picture with every watering and turning
            them into a progress video. However the app needs more flexibility
            built in. The app doesn’t have access to my camera so when I take a
            picture at watering time it doesn’t add it to my camera roll. I can
            see some people might not like to fill their camera roll with plant
            pictures but it should be an option. Also there is no way to load a
            photo not taken with the app.

            Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship
            Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to
            seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man
            has gone before. Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but
            it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to
            ensure the survival of the human species.
